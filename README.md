# GeoStatistical Image Fusion
* Image Fusion is the method for enhancing information content in the images.
* Using Image Fusion spectral quality of high spatial resolution images can be improved.
* Geostatistical techniques i.e. Cokriging and Regression Kriging have been used in this project to fuse images.
# Data Used
* Landsat 8 Satellite images (acquired from USGS).

# Objective
* Fusion of Multispectral bands with Panchromatic band using Ordinary  Cokriging (COK) and Regression Kriging (RK).
* Spectral and Spatial Quality assessment of fused Images.


# Prerequisites
There are certain prerequirements that needs to be fulfilled. These are as follows: 
1. **R:** It is a programming laguage for stati
2. **GSTAT:** It is also required to be installed on the machine, and can be obtained from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)!
